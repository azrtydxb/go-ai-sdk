# Questions procoder cannot answer for you

Answer each one by writing a line beginning `Answer: ` under it, then
hand the file back with `procoder ask --file .procoder/ask/QA.md`.
Leave the `Key:` lines alone — they are what ties an answer to its question.

## Q1: [decision] decisions.md

Key: 8197b535e994
Question: Landing the allowlist commit: the gate's per-file gitleaks scan can't see .gitleaks.toml — how to commit?

Verified: procoder's gate runs `gitleaks dir <changed-file>` per file; gitleaks 8.30 hard-codes the DEFAULT config for single-file sources (repo config only applies to directory scans or via the GITLEAKS_CONFIG env). So the allowlist clears whole-tree scans but not the gate's per-file scan, which still blocks committing `.procoder/ask/` (its `Key:` lines). Options:

- **A) Split the commit**: land `.gitleaks.toml` + docs/code changes now (they contain no Key lines, so the gate passes); leave the ask records (QA.md, answers.md) for a later commit. (Default — gets the reviewed config in without weakening the gate.)
- **B) Patch procoder** (the dev repo at ~/Development/procoder): make the per-file scan pass `-c <root>/.gitleaks.toml` when present, rebuild the launcher binary, then commit everything. Root-cause fix; procoder-side change, out of this session's scope.
- **C) Set GITLEAKS_CONFIG** in the environments the hooks run in, commit everything now. Works with the current binary; depends on the hook process inheriting the variable.
- **D) Skip the gate for this commit** (`--no-verify`). Against the contract; last resort.

Answer: A and B: the split-commit (A) was superseded because the gate scans the whole branch diff, not just staged files — B (patch procoder's per-file gitleaks scan to pass -c when a repo .gitleaks.toml exists, committed in the procoder repo) was done first, then all files committed together (user: A and B next)
